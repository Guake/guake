Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Manual keybinding
-----------------

If you want to trigger guake manually, for instance on system where ``libkeybinder3`` does not work,
you can register the following snippet in your window manager

.. code-block:: bash

    dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.guake3.RemoteControl \
        /org/guake3/RemoteControl org.guake3.RemoteControl.show_hide

You can use the simpler:

.. code-block:: bash

    guake-toggle

Please note the command `guake -t` will also toggle Guake but since it initialize a bit more than just
necessary, it can be slower that the two previous commands.

Note on Wayland
---------------

There are some reports of Guake not opening when a Wayland app or empty desktop is focused.
The issue has been reported on Ubuntu 17.10 LTS, Fedora 26 and Fedora 27.
For more context, see issue #1041.

The workaround is setting a manual keybinding as described above.
On Fedora 26, for example, this can be accomplished by going to *Settings > Keyboard* and
adding a new custom shortcut to execute :code:`guake-toggle`.

Note for Archlinux users
------------------------

This applies to users of Archlinux based distributions too and may be of help to non
Debian/Ubuntu users as well. Currently ``make install`` is optimized for Ubuntu, which
does not mean that it cannot be used on other systems, but depending on your system
you may have to tell ``make install`` where to install guake
(the default for Ubuntu is ``/usr/local/lib/python3.x/dist-packages/guake``).

So on Ubuntu the following commands are equivalent:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local

On Archlinux this can be done by passing ``/usr`` as ``PREFIX``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo make install PREFIX=/usr

which changes the installation destination to ``/usr/lib/python3.x/site-packages/guake``.

Note that the install script automatically determines whether to use
``dist-packages`` or ``site-packages``.

For more details checkout the official PKGBUILD at
`archlinux.org <https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/guake/>`_, the PKGBUILD on
the `aur <http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/guake-git>`_ or this
`gist <https://gist.github.com/aichingm/ed35ba3b136be4424b1ac947207dbca3>`_.

Why Guake crashes with Tmux and Byubu?
--------------------------------------

Tmux and Byobu can be used as shell instead of bash or zsh, but you should be sure to disable the
"use login shell" option. If set, Guake will not be able to start. Use ``dconf-editor`` to reset
this option if Guake cannot start again.
