Install from Pypi
=================

Guake is now automatically published on Pypi.
Please use the following command to install on your environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install --user guake


Avoid using ``pip install guake`` without the ``--user``, you may break
your system.

Install from source
===================

If you want to install Guake from its sources, please follow this procedure:

- First, **DO NOT USE TARBALLS GENERATED BY GITHUB** on the Release Page. They
  are automatically generated and cannot be used alone. We use a package, namely
  ``PBR``, that requires the full git history to work.

  Checkout the HEAD of the source tree with:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ git clone https://github.com/Guake/guake.git

- make sure that you have the needed system dependencies (Python GTK, VTE, ...)
  installed for your system.
  If you are unsure about the dependencies, you can run this script to install them:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ ./scripts/bootstrap-dev-[debian, arch, fedora].sh run make

Note: Insert your distribution in the square brackets.

To install Guake itself, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To uninstall, still in the source directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make
    $ sudo make uninstall

Tips for a complete Guake reinstallation (without system dependencies):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo make uninstall && make && sudo make install
    $ # Or use this shortcut:
    $ make reinstall  # (do not sudo it!)
