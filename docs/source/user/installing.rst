Installing Guake
================

System-wide installation
========================

Always prefere using your package manager to install guake.

Debian / Ubuntu
---------------

Ubuntu and Debian users will use ``sudo apt install guake``.

Fedora
------

Tested in 29: 
We can use dnf to install it. 

```bash 
sudo dnf install -y guake
```

Then you can open it via:

```bash
guake
```

To allow global 'F12' to open the guake, go to Setting >> Device >> Keyboard >> Scroll to bottom >> "+" to create a new global short cut with 'F12' keybinding and comand 'guake'. 

You may notice the style may have some error. You can fix this by installing and apply custom theme. 

```bash 
sudo dnf install -y arc-theme gnome-tweaks 
```

Then use 

```bash 
gnome-tweaks
```

to change theme to change theme to one of the yakuake will fix this. 


Arch Linux
----------

Guake is available on *community* repository, just use: ``sudo pacman -S guake`` to install it.

Install from Pypi
=================

Guake is now automatically published on Pypi.
Please use the following command to install on your environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install --user guake


Avoid using ``pip install guake`` without the ``--user``, you may break
your system.

You need to ensure the following points are met in your configuration:

- ``$HOME/.local/bin`` should be in your ``$PATH``
- You need to have some dependencies installed on your system:

  - ``gir1.2-keybinder-3.0``
  - ``gir1.2-notify-0.7``
  - ``gir1.2-vte-2.91``
  - ``libkeybinder-3.0-0``
  - ``libutempter0``
  - ``python3-setuptools``
  - ``python3-cairo``
  - ``python3-dbus``
  - ``python3-gi``
  - ``python3-pbr``
  - ``python3-pip``
  - ``python3``

Install from source
===================

If you want to install Guake from its sources, please follow this procedure:

- First, **DO NOT USE TARBALLS GENERATED BY GITHUB** on the Release Page. They
  are automatically generated and cannot be used alone. We use a package, namely
  ``PBR``, that requires the full git history to work.

  Checkout the HEAD of the source tree with:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ git clone https://github.com/Guake/guake.git

- make sure that you have the needed system dependencies (Python GTK, VTE, ...)
  installed for your system.
  If you are unsure about the dependencies, you can run this script to install them:

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ ./scripts/bootstrap-dev-[debian, arch, fedora].sh run make

Note: Insert your distribution in the square brackets.

To install Guake itself, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To uninstall, still in the source directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make
    $ sudo make uninstall

Tips for a complete Guake reinstallation (without system dependencies):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo make uninstall && make && sudo make install
    $ # Or use this shortcut:
    $ make reinstall  # (do not sudo it!)
