Compatibility
=============

The Team is willing to see Guake available on every major Linux distribution. Do not hesitate to
contact us through GitHub Issue or directly by email (``gaetan [at] xeberon.net)`` if you see any
issue when packageing Guake.

The major compatibility issues we experience if with the different version of VTE. We try to
integrate new cool VTE features when they are ready, and protect them with test on the version
installed on the user's environment, but there may still be mistakes made, breaking the software
for a given environment. Do not hesitate to warn us for that!
