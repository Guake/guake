		<p>
			Guake is a top-down terminal for Gnome, and is highly inspired by the famous terminal used in Quake.
			You can instantaneously show and hide your terminal with a single key stroke, execute a command, and then go back to your previous task without breaking your workflow. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine you are working in your favorite text editor and want to execute some commands, like execute the unit test of your code, check a man page, or edit some configuration file.
			You can do it at lightning speed without leaving your keyboard.
			Just press your predefined "Show Guake" hotkey, execute your command, and press it again to hide the terminal and go back to your work.
