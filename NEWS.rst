3.2.1

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Thanks to @arcticicestudio, a new nice, clean new palette theme is available for Guake users:
   Nord (#1275)

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Multiline url are sometimes not handled correctly.
-  Users of Byobu or Tmux as default shell should disable the "login shell" option (in the "Shell"
   panel). This uses an option, ``--login``, that does not exist on these two tools.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  Fix duplication in theme list (#1304)
-  Fix right click selection in Midnight Commander
-  Corrected usage of ``Vte.Regex.new_for_match`` to fix regular expression matching (hyperlinks,
   quick open) on VTE >0.50 (#1295)
-  URL with ``'`` (simple quote) and ``()`` (parenthesis) are now captured by hyperlink matcher.
   This may causes some issues with log and so that use parenthesis *around* hyperlinks, but since
   parenthesis and quotes are valid characters inside a URL, like for instance URL created by
   Kibana, they deserve the right to be shown as proper url in Guake.

   User can still select the URL in the terminal if he wishes to capture the exact url, before doing
   a Ctrl+click or a right click.

   For developers, it is advised to end the URL with a character that cannot be used in URL, such as
   space, tab, new line. Ending with a dot (``.``) or a comma (``,``) will not be seen as part of
   the URL by Guake, so most logs and traces that adds a dot or a comma at the end of the URL might
   still work.

3.1.0
-----

Release Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version of Guake brings mostly bug fixes, and some new features like "Quick Open on selection".
I have also reworked internally the Quick Open so that it can automatically open files from logs
from pytest and other python development tools output. However, there might still some false
positive on the hovering of the mouse in the terminal, the most famous being the output of ``ls -l``
which may have the mouse looks like it sees hyperlinks on the terminal everywhere. Click does
nothing but its an annoying limitation. Package maintainers should read the "Notes for Package
Maintainers" of this release note carefully.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  New "start at login" option in the settings (only for GNOME) #251
-  Add ``--verbose``/``-v`` parameter to enable debug logging. Please note the existing ``-v`` (for
   version number) has been renamed ``-V``.
-  Support for hyperlink VTE extension (`described
   here <https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda>`__ ) #945 (Untested, as
   it requires VTE 0.50)
-  Add great color palettes from `Guake Color
   Scheme <https://github.com/ziyenano/Guake-Color-Schemes>`__, thanks for @ziyenano :

-  Allow application to capture right click (ex: Midnight commander). #1096. It is still possible to
   show the contextual menu with Shift+right click.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  delete tab even without libutempter (#1198)
-  Fix crash when changing command file #1229
-  fix ``import sys`` in ``simplegladeapp.py``
-  change scope of ``which_align`` variable in ``pref.py`` (#1225)
-  Fix several issues on Quick Edit:

   -  quick open freezes guake
   -  support for systems with PCRE2 (regular expression in terminal) disabled for VTE, like Ubuntu
      17.10 and +.

      This might disable quick open and open url on direct Ctrl+click. User can still select the
      wanted url or text and Cltr+click or use contextual menu.

      See this `discussion on Tilix <https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/issues/916>`__, another
      Terminal emulator that suffurs the same issue.

   -  quick open now appears in contextual menu (#1157)
   -  bad translation update on the contextual menu. This causes new strings that was hidden to
      appear for translators.
   -  Fix quick open on pattern "File:line" line that was not opening the wanted file.
-  Fix user interface translations #1228
-  Some systems such as Ubuntu did displayed Guake with a translated interface (#1209). The locale
   system has been reworked to fix that.
-  There might be broken translations, or not up-to-date language support by Guake. A global refresh
   of all existing translations would be welcomed. Most has not been updated since the transition to
   Guake 3, so these languages support might probably be unfunctional or at least partialy
   localized.
-  A big thank you for all the volunteers and Guake enthousiats would often update their own
   translation to help guake being used world-wide.

   -  Help is always welcomed for updating translations !
-  Support for vte 2.91 (0.52) #1222

Notes for Package Maintainers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The setup mecanism has changed a little bit. Some maintainers used to patch the source code of
   Guake to change the pixmap, Gtk schema or locale paths directly in the ``guake/globals.py`` file.
   This was due to a lack of flexibility of the installation target of the ``Makefile``.

   The ``make install`` target looks now a little bit more familiar, allowing distribution packager
   to set the various paths directly with make flags.

   For example:

   .. code:: bash

     sudo make install \
         prefix=/usr \
         DESTDIR=/path/for/packager \
         PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGE_NAME=site-package \
         localedir=/usr/share/locale

   The main overrides are:

   -  ``IMAGE_DIR``: where the pixmap should be installed. Default:
      ``/usr/local/share/guake/pixmaps``
   -  ``localedir``: where locales should be installed. Default: ``/usr/local/share/locale``
   -  ``GLADE_DIR``: where the Glade files should be installed. Default: ``/usr/local/share/guake``
   -  ``gsettingsschemadir``: where gsettings/dconf schema should be installed. Default:
      ``/usr/local/share/glib-2.0/schemas/``

   I invite package maintainers to open tickets on Github about any other difficulties encountered
   when packaging Guake.

3.0.5
-----

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  Apply cursor blinking to new tabs as well, not only on settings change.
-  Fix window losefocus hotkey #1080
-  Fix refocus if open #1188
-  fix preferences window header color, align the close button more nicely and change borders to
   margins
-  Implements a timestamp for wayland (#1215)

3.0.4
-----

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Add window displacement options to move guake away from the screen edges
-  User can manually enter the name of the GTK theme it wants Guake to use. Note there is no
   Preference settings yet, one needs to manually enter the name using ``dconf-editor``, in the key
   ``/apps/guake/general/gtk-theme-name``. Use a name matching one the folders in
   ``/usr/share/themes``. Please also considere this is a early adopter features and has only been
   tested on Ubuntu systems. Dark theme preference can be se with the key
   ``/apps/guake/general/gtk-prefer-dark-theme``.
-  Allow make install-system to be run as non root user and print a message if so.
-  Quick open can now open file under selection. Simply select a filename in the current terminal
   and do a Ctrl+click, if the file path can be found, it will be open in your editor. It allows to
   virtually open any file path in your terminal (if they are on your local machine), but requires
   the user to select the file path first, compared to the Quick Open feature that finds file names
   using regular expression.

   Also notes that is it able to look in the current folder if the selected file name exists,
   allowing Ctrl+click on relative paths as well.

   Line number syntax is also supported: ``filename.txt:5`` will directly on the 5th line if your
   Quick Open is set for.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  fixes issue with vertically stacked dual monitors #1162
-  Quick Open functionnality is restored #1121
-  Unusable Guake with "hide on focus lose" option #1152
-  Speed up guake D-Bus communication (command line such as ``guake -t``).

3.0.3
-----

Release Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This minor release mainly focus on fixing big problems that was remaining after the migration to
GTK3. I would like to akwonledge the work of some contributors that helped testing and reporting
issues on Guake 3.0.0. Thanks a lot to @egmontkob and @aichingm.

The Preference window has been deeply reworked and the hotkey management has been rewriten. This was
one the the major regression in Guake 3.0.

-  [dev env]: Add the possibility to terminate guake with ``Ctrl+c`` on terminal where Guake has
   been launched
-  Add "Infinite scrolling" option in "Scrolling" panel #274
-  Added hotkey for showing and focusing Guake window when it is opened or closed. It is convenient
   when Guake window are overlapped with another windows and user needs to just showing it without
   closing and opening it again. #1133

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Quick Edit feature is not working (#1121)

Deprecations

   ``Ctrl+Shift+R``) #1101, #1098
-  The hotkey management has been rewriten and is now fully functional
-  Rework the Preference window and reorganize the settings. Lot of small issues has been fixed. The
   Preference window now fits in a 1024x768 screen.
-  Fix 'Failed to execute child process "-"' - #1119
-  History size spin is fixed and now increment by 1000 steps. Default history value is now set to
   1000, because "1024" has no real meaning for end user. #1082

-  The dependencies of the Guake executable has been slightly better described in README. There is
   an example for Debian/Ubuntu in the file ``scripts/bootstrap-dev-debian.sh`` which is the main
   environment where Guake is developed and tested.
-  Package maintainers are encouraged to submit their ``bootstrap-dev-[distribution].sh``,
   applicable for other distributions, to help users install Guake from source, and other package
   maintainers.

3.0.2

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

-  Code cleaning and GNOME desktop file conformance

3.0.0
-----

Release Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Guake has been ported to GTK-3 thanks to the huge work of @aichingm. This also implies Guake now
uses the latest version of the terminal emulator component, VTE 2.91. Guake is now only working on
Python 3 (version 3.5 or 3.6). Official support for Python 2 has been dropped. This enables new
features in upcoming releases, such as "find in terminal", or "split screen".

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Ported to GTK3:

     -  cli arguments
     -  D-Bus
     -  context menu of the terminal, the tab bar and the tray icon
     -  scrollbar of the terminal
     -  ``ctrl+d`` on terminal
     -  fix double click on the tab bar
     -  fix double click on tab to rename
     -  fix clipboard from context menu
     -  notification module
     -  keyboard shortcuts
     -  preference screen
     -  port ``gconfhandler`` to ``gsettingshandler``
     -  about dialog
     -  pattern matching
     -  ``Guake.accel*`` methods
-  Guake now use a brand new build system:

     -  ``pipenv`` to manage dependencies in Pipfile
     -  enforced code styling and checks using Pylint, Flake8, Yapf, ISort.
     -  simpler release management thanks to PBR
-  [dev env] `reno <https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/>`__ will be used to generate release
   notes for Guake starting version 3.0.0. It allows developers to write the right chunk that will
   appear in the release note directly from their Pull Request.
-  Update Guake window title when:

     -  the active tab changes
     -  the active tab is renamed
     -  the vte title changes

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Translation might be broken in some language, waiting for the translation file to be updated by
   volunteers
-  Resizer does not work anymore
-  Package maintainers have to rework their integration script completely
-  quick open and open link in terminal is broken
-  **Note for package maintainers**: Guake 3 has a minor limitation regarding Glib/GTK Schemas
   files. Guake looks for the gsettings schema inside its data directory. So you will probably need
   install the schema twice, once in ``/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/guake/data/`` and once
   in ``/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas`` (see `#1064 <https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1064>`__).
   This is planned to be fixed in Guake 3.1

Upgrade Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Minor rework of the preference window.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Background picture is no more customizable on each terminal
-  Visual Bell has been deprecated

Version 0.8.1
-------------

  I started working on Guake 1.0.0, and not in a dedicated branch. It is now in its own source
  folder. We clearly need to move to gtk3 soon, since GTK2 is being discontinued, the VTE is no more
  maintained for GTK2-Python, and adds lot of cool features.

  So I am now starting to work on a complete rewrite of Guake, so don't expect 0.8.x to see lot of
  new features, unfortunately. But Guake 1.0.0 will add features such as:

   - line wrap in terminal
   - search in terminal
   - dconf/gsettings to store configuration
   - GTK3 look and feel
   - much cleaner build and translation systems

  But, this means I cannot work too much on 0.8.x. I still do some bug fixes, and thanks to external
  contributors that share the love for Guake, Guake 0.8 still moves on!

  So don't hesitate to have a look in the code to fix any bug you are experiencing and submit a Pull
  Request.

  New features:

  - a-la guake-indicator custom commands (#564) - by @Ozzyboshi!
  - Add option to allow/disallow bold font (#603) - by @helix84!
  - Clean current terminal item in contextual menu (#608) - by @Denis Subbotin

  Bug fixes:

  - Terminal widget disappears at random times (#592)
  - Typo - by @selivan, @Ruined1


Version 0.8.0
-------------

  I have been extremely busy the previous 3 months, so I have almost not worked on Guake. I wanted
  to introduce in the next version some major features heavily asked, like session save and split
  terminal. They will have to wait a bit more.

  As a result, most of the contribution are from external contributors. Thank you very much for all
  these patches!

  This releases introduces two major changes in the project, thus the minor version change.

  First, the new homepage is now online:

    http://guake-project.org/

  As I remind you, Guake has *not* control over the old domain guake.org. So far the content is
  still one of the old content of this domain. So please use http://guake-project.org to reference
  Guake.

  Source code of the Web site can be found here:

    https://github.com/Guake/guake-website

  The second major change in the project is the abandon of our internal hotkey manager
  ``globalhotkey``, which was responsible for binding hotkeys globally to the window manager. This
  piece of code was extremely old and hard to maintain. This was also unnecessarily complexifying
  the build process of Guake. Thanks to the contribution of @jenrik, we are now using a pretty
  common package ``keybinder`` (Ubuntu: ``python-keybinder``).

  Bug fixes:


  - Guake fails to start due to a GlobalHotkey related C call fixed by replacing GlobalHotkeys with
    keybinder. Fixed by @jenrik. (#558, #510)
  - Fix icon issue with appindicator (#591)
  - swap terms correctly when moving tabs (#473, #512, #588)
  - Remove last reference to --show-hide (#587)
  - fixed and completed german translation (#585)
  - Drop duplicated man page (a526046a)
  - use full path to tray icon with libappindicator (#591)


Version 0.7.2 (2015.05.20)
--------------------------

  Bug fixes:

  - Fix Ctrl+D regresion (#550)
  - update Quick Open Preference Window


Version 0.7.1 (2015.05.18):
---------------------------

  Some bug fixes, and cleared issues with new palette colors.

  As side note, our domain 'guake.org' has been squatted by an outsider that seems only interested
  in getting money to release the domain. Since Guake is a small project, based on 100% OpenSource
  spirit, we do not want to loose more time on this subject. The guake website will be deployed soon
  on a new URL:

      http://guake-project.org

  Please do **NOT** use guake.org anymore, until we can retrieve it. We cannot be hold responsible
  for any content on guake.org anymore.

  Bug fixes:

  - Background and font color inversed for some color schemes (#516)
  - Guake width wrong on non-Unity Ubuntu desktop (#517)
  - Add get_gtktab_name dbus interface (#529, #530)
  - Fix issue with selection copy (#514)
  - I18n fixes and updated Polish translation (#519). Thanks a lot @piotrdrag!
  - Remove add and guake icon in tab (#543)
  - prompt_on_close_tab option (#546) Thanks a lot @tobz1000!
  - Fix default shortcuts for move tabs


Version 0.7.0 (2015.05.02):
---------------------------

  I had more time working on Guake recently, so I fixed some long term issues, and exposed some
  internal settings into the preference window.

  Thanks for the external contribution: @varemenos, @seraff and others!

  Here is the complete changelog for this release:

  - Reorganised palette definition, add a demo terminal in preference panel (#504, #273, #220)
  - Plenty of other new color palettes (thanks again @varemenos ! #504)

  - Fix compatibility with Ubuntu 15.04 (#509)
  - Fix Guake Turns Gray sometimes (#473, #512)

Version 0.6.1 (2015.04.19):
---------------------------
  - bug fixes


Version 0.6.0 (2015.04.18):
---------------------------
  This version is poor in new feature, I just don't have time to work on Guake. I got a lot of
  incompatibility reports on new systems, such as Wayland. Port to gtk3 is still a must have, but
  all features of the VTE component does not seem to have been ported.

  Features:

   - Save current terminal buffer to file
   - Hotkeys for moving tab
   - plenty of color palettes (thanks @varemenos !)
   - bug fixes


Version 0.5.2 (2014.11.23):
---------------------------
