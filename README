Guake README file
=================

INTRO
~~~~~

Guake is a dropdown terminal made for the GNOME desktop
environment. Its style of window is based on an fps games, and one of
its goals is be easy to reach.

Guake is written mostly in python and has a little piece in C (global
hotkey stuff). The code is placed in the src directory. Files and
images are in the data directory. If you're looking for translation
stuff, you should take a look at the po directory.

DEPENDENCIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Python2.4+
 * pygtk2.10 (gtk.StatusIcon)
 * python-vte
 * python-notify
 * python-dbus
 * python-gconf

To build guake, you will need the following packages too:
 * python-dev
 * gtk+-2.0-dev
 * pygtk-dev
 * gconf2-dev (to use some autoconf stuff)

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
We are using an autotools based installation, so if you got the source
of guake from a release file, please do the following::

    $ gunzip -c guake-x.x.x.tar.gz | tar x
    $ cd guake-x.x.x
    $ ./configure && make
    $ su
    (give the root password here!)
    # make install

If you receive a message asking you if you have installed
guake.schemas properly when launching guake, it means that your
default sysconfdir is different from the one choosen by autotools. To
fix that, you probably have to append the param `--sysconfdir=/etc' to
your `./configure' call, like this::

    $ ./configure --sysconfidir=/etc && make

If it is not enought you can call, you can install the gconf schemas
file by hand doing the following::

    # gconftool-2 --makefile-install-rule data/guake.schemas

For more install details, please read the `INSTALL` file.
