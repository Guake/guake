Version 0.8.1
=============

  I started working on Guake 1.0.0, and not in a dedicated branch. It is now in its own source
  folder. We clearly need to move to gtk3 soon, since GTK2 is being discontinued, the VTE is no more
  maintained for GTK2-Python, and adds lot of cool features.

  So I am now starting to work on a complete rewrite of Guake, so don't expect 0.8.x to see lot of
  new features, unfortunately. But Guake 1.0.0 will add features such as:
   - line wrap in terminal
   - search in terminal
   - dconf/gsettings to store configuration
   - GTK3 look and feel
   - much cleaner build and translation systems

  But, this means I cannot work too much on 0.8.x. I still do some bug fixes, and thanks to external
  contributors that share the love for Guake, Guake 0.8 still moves on!

  So don't hesitate to have a look in the code to fix any bug you are experiencing and submit a Pull
  Request.

  New features:
  - a-la guake-indicator custom commands (#564) - by @Ozzyboshi!
  - Add option to allow/disallow bold font (#603) - by @helix84!
  - Clean current terminal item in contextual menu (#608) - by @Denis Subbotin

  Bug fixes:
  - Terminal widget disappears at random times (#592)
  - Typo - by @selivan, @Ruined1


Version 0.8.0
=============

  I have been extremely busy the previous 3 months, so I have almost not worked on Guake. I wanted
  to introduce in the next version some major features heavily asked, like session save and split
  terminal. They will have to wait a bit more.

  As a result, most of the contribution are from external contributors. Thank you very much for all
  these patches!

  This releases introduces two major changes in the project, thus the minor version change.

  First, the new homepage is now online:

    http://guake-project.org/

  As I remind you, Guake has *not* control over the old domain guake.org. So far the content is
  still one of the old content of this domain. So please use http://guake-project.org to reference
  Guake.

  Source code of the Web site can be found here:

    https://github.com/Guake/guake-website

  The second major change in the project is the abandon of our internal hotkey manager
  ``globalhotkey``, which was responsible for binding hotkeys globally to the window manager. This
  piece of code was extremely old and hard to maintain. This was also unnecessarily complexifying
  the build process of Guake. Thanks to the contribution of @jenrik, we are now using a pretty
  common package ``keybinder`` (Ubuntu: ``python-keybinder``).

  Bug fixes:
  - Guake fails to start due to a GlobalHotkey related C call fixed by replacing GlobalHotkeys with
    keybinder. Fixed by @jenrik. (#558, #510)
  - Fix icon issue with appindicator (#591)
  - swap terms correctly when moving tabs (#473, #512, #588)
  - Remove last reference to --show-hide (#587)
  - fixed and completed german translation (#585)
  - Drop duplicated man page (a526046a)
  - use full path to tray icon with libappindicator (#591)


Version 0.7.2 (2015.05.20)
==========================

  Bug fixes:
  - Fix Ctrl+D regresion (#550)
  - update Quick Open Preference Window


Version 0.7.1 (2015.05.18):
===========================

  Some bug fixes, and cleared issues with new palette colors.

  As side note, our domain 'guake.org' has been squatted by an outsider that seems only interested
  in getting money to release the domain. Since Guake is a small project, based on 100% OpenSource
  spirit, we do not want to loose more time on this subject. The guake website will be deployed soon
  on a new URL:

      http://guake-project.org

  Please do **NOT** use guake.org anymore, until we can retrieve it. We cannot be hold responsible
  for any content on guake.org anymore.

  Bug fixes:
  - Background and font color inversed for some color schemes (#516)
  - Guake width wrong on non-Unity Ubuntu desktop (#517)
  - Add get_gtktab_name dbus interface (#529, #530)
  - Fix issue with selection copy (#514)
  - I18n fixes and updated Polish translation (#519). Thanks a lot @piotrdrag!
  - Remove add and guake icon in tab (#543)
  - prompt_on_close_tab option (#546) Thanks a lot @tobz1000!
  - Fix default shortcuts for move tabs


Version 0.7.0 (2015.05.02):
===========================

  I had more time working on Guake recently, so I fixed some long term issues, and exposed some
  internal settings into the preference window.

  Thanks for the external contribution: @varemenos, @seraff and others!

  Here is the complete changelog for this release:

===========================

Version 0.6.0 (2015.04.18):
===========================
  This version is poor in new feature, I just don't have time to work on Guake. I got a lot of

  all features of the VTE component does not seem to have been ported.

   - bug fixes


Version 0.5.2 (2014.11.23):
===========================

   work in all systems.
 - lot of "componentization" of the code, in preparation to the rebase of 'gtk3' branch.
