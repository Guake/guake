# Change prelude_section_name to 'release_summary' from default value
# 'prelude'.
prelude_section_name: release_summary
template: |
  release_summary: >
    Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this
    release. All of the prelude content is merged together and then rendered
    separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so the text
    needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items make sense
    when read independently. This may mean repeating some details. Not every
    release note requires a prelude. Usually only notes describing major
    features or adding release theme details should have a prelude.
  features:
    - |
      List new features here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.
  known_issues:
    - |
      List known issues here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.
  upgrade:
    - |
      List upgrade notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.
  deprecations:
    - |
      List deprecations notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list
      items in this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so
      the text needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information
      only available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean
      repeating some details.
  security:
    - |
      Add security notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.
  fixes:
    - |
      Add normal bug fixes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items
      in this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the
      text needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.
  translations:
    - Only put list of updated language <lang> (ex: fr_FR)

      Add other notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
