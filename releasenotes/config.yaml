# Change prelude_section_name to 'release_summary' from default value
# 'prelude'.
prelude_section_name: release_summary
template: |
  release_summary: >
    Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this
    release.

    All of the prelude content is merged together and then rendered
    separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so the text
    needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items make sense
    when read independently.
