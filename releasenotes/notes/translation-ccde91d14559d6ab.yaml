fixes:
  - Some systems such as Ubuntu did displayed Guake with a translated interface (#1209). The locale
    system has been reworked to fix that.

  -  There might be broken translations, or not up-to-date language support by Guake.
    A global refresh of all existing translations would be welcomed.
    Most has not been updated since the transition to Guake 3, so these languages support
    might probably be unfunctional or at least partialy localized.

  - A big thank you for all the volunteers and Guake enthousiats would often update their own
    translation to help guake being used world-wide.

   - Help is always welcomed for updating translations !
