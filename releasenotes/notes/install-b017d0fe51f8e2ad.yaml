  Package maintainers should read the "Notes for Package Maintainers" of this release
  note carefully.

    The setup mecanism has changed a little bit. Some maintainers used to patch the source code
    of Guake to change the pixmap, Gtk schema or locale paths directly in the ``guake/globals.py``
    file. This was due to a lack of flexibility of the installation target of the ``Makefile``.

    The ``make install`` target looks now a little bit more familiar, allowing distribution
    packager to set the various paths directly with make flags.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo make install \
            PREFIX=/usr \
            DIST_PACKAGE_NAME=site-package \
            DATADIR=/usr/share/ \
            LOCALE_DIR=/usr/share/locale

    I invite package maintainers to open tickets on Github about any other difficulties
    encountered when packaging Guake.
