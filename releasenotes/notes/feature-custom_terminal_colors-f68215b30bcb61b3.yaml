    When a user changes a background color of a terminal or a tab, this color is saved, and cannot
    be reset by changing settings. This is OK.
    The issue is that the user cannot set color transparency, and the transparency becomes fixed
    until the terminal colors are reset by the user (with a --reset* command or via the tab
    context menu.
