    Wayland is a bit more well supported. The X11 backend is now used by default for
    GDK and it seems to make the shortcut works under most situation.

    A more cleaner solution would be to develop a GAction
    (`vote for this feature here <https://feathub.com/Guake/guake/+29>`_])

    A new command has been added: ``guake-toggle``, should be faster than
    ``guake -t``. You can use it when you register the global shortcut manually
    (X11 or Wayland).
