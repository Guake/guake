release_summary: >
  Guake has been ported to GTK-3 thanks to the huge work of @aichingm.
  This also implies Guake uses the latest the underlying terminal emulator component, VTE 2.91.
  This enables new features in upcoming releases, such as "find in terminal", or "split screen".

  Guake is now only working on Python 3 (version 3.5 or 3.6). Official support for Python 2
  has been dropped.
