    Fix several issues on Quick Edit:

    - quick open freezes guake
    - support system with PCRE2 (regular expression in terminal) disabled, like Ubuntu 17.10.
      This disables quick open and open url on direct Ctrl+click. User can still select the wanted
      url or text and Cltr+click or use contextual menu.

      See this `discussion on Tilix <https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/issues/916>`_, another
      Terminal emulator that suffurs the same issue.

    - quick open now appears in contextual menu (#1157)
    - bad translation update on the contextual menu. This causes new strings that was hidden to
      appear for translators.
