release_summary: >
  Re-implemented the refocus functionality.

  This functionality allows the user to return the focus to an open guake window.
  It happened to be partially be maintained but faced issues in the migration to Gtk3.

  The functionality was revived, partially based on commented-out code found in Guake.show_hide().
