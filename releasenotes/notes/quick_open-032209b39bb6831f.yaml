    Quick open can now open file under selection. Simply select a filename in the current terminal
    and do a Ctrl+click, if the file path can be found, it will be open in your editor. It allows
    to virtually open any file path in your terminal (if they are on your local machine), but
    requires the user to select the file path first, compared to the Quick Open feature that
    finds file names using regular expression.

    Also notes that is it able to look in the current folder if the selected file name exists,
    allowing Ctrl+click on relative paths as well.

    Line number syntax is also supported: ``filename.txt:5`` will directly on the 5th line if
    your Quick Open is set for.
