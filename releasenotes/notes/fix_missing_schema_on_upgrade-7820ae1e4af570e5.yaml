release_summary: >
    Fix missing or malformed schema files when upgrading guake

upgrade:
  - |
    Should fix the errors with malformed schema files when upgrading guake.

fixes:
  - |
      - Does not start after upgrade to 3.7.0 with pip3 due to faulty schema #1718
      - (Potentially) Guake 3.6.3 missing gschemas.compiled in PyPi #1621

notes_for_package_maintainers:
  - |
    Should resolve issues with the gschemas.compiled file. Make sure that the location
    org.guake.gschema.xml is being saved to is user executable if guake is installed in
    userspace so that guake can compile and create gschemas.compiled.
    
    If the destination for org.guake.gschema.xml cannot be user executable, make sure to
    include:

    glib-compile-schemas [schema directory]

    In the installation script, replacing [schema directory] with the place
    org.guake.gschema.xml is being saved.
