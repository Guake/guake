    URL with ``'`` (simple quote) and ``()`` (parenthesis) are now captured by hyperlink matcher.
    This may causes some issues with log and so that use parenthesis *around* hyperlinks,
    but since parenthesis and quotes are valid characters inside a URL, like for instance
    URL created by Kibana, they deserve the right to be shown as proper url in Guake.

    User can still select the URL in the terminal if he wishes to capture the exact url, before
    doing a Ctrl+click or a right click.

    For developers, it is advised to end the URL with a character that cannot be used in URL, such
    as space, tab, new line. Ending with a dot (``.``) or a comma (``,``) will not be seen as part
    of the URL by Guake, so most logs and traces that adds a dot or a comma at the end of the URL
    might still work.

known_issues:
  - Multiline url are sometimes not handled correctly.
