release_summary: >
  Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this
  release.

  All of the prelude content is merged together and then rendered
  separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so the text
  needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items make sense
  when read independently.

  Do not use "list" syntax here
