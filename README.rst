Note when compiling from source
-------------------------------

Do **NOT** use the Tarball packages automatically generated by GitHub on the Release pages. They
won't work because one of the main components of Guake build system, PBR, requires the full Git
history to be available when building from source. Note this does not impact source distribution
packages you can download from Pypi.

Build from sources instructions are described on
`this page of the Online Documentation <http://guake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installing.html#install-from-source>`_.
Please read this carefully before opening an issue!
